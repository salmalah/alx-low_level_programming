# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
### Concepts 
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
* [Pointers and arrays](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/60)

## Resources
### Read or watch:
* [C - Pointer to Pointer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointer_to_pointer.htm)
* [C – Pointer to Pointer with example](https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-pointer-to-pointer/)
* [Multi-dimensional Arrays in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_multi_dimensional_arrays.htm)
* [Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example] (https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/2d-arrays-in-c-example/)
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/)
## General
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
## Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* ou are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
## More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.
