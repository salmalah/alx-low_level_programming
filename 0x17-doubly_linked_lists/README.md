# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
## Resources
**Read or watch:**
* [What is a Doubly Linked List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0pjD12bzP0)
## General
* What is a doubly linked list
* How to use doubly linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf and exit
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
## More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:
```
/**
 * struct dlistint_s - doubly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous node
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 *
 */
typedef struct dlistint_s
{
    int n;
    struct dlistint_s *prev;
    struct dlistint_s *next;
} dlistint_t;
```
