* [create dynamic libraries on Linux](https://www.google.com/#q=linux+create+dynamic+library)
## General
* What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
* Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
## Requirements
### Bash
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your files should end with a new line (why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
* All your files must be executable
### C
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
