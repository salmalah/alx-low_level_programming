## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/),**without the help of Google:**
## General
* What are structures, when, why and how to use them
* How to use typedef
## Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* The only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free and exit.
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* All your header files should be include guarded
